# QuoteSearch: efficient search engine for precise quotes
QuoteSearch is a web application search tool that allows users to quickly search for quotes of any desired topic. These topics can be themes (love, childhood, growth, etc.), specific textual excerpts, or authors/speakers. The search engine uses real-time search, meaning each character input in the search bar shows updated results. There is no need for a search button. The dataset I am using is a Kaggle dataset [Quotes](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/manann/quotes-500k) that includes almost 500,000 quotes. Each quote has features "quote", "author", and "categories".

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
